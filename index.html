            of PyCon AU.</p>
          <p>DjangoCon AU content will be Django specific, but there will also
            be useful Django-related content in the main PyCon program.</p>
          <p>There will also be Django developers at the sprints held after
            PyCon.</p>

	    <p class="description">In this talk, we will first agree to commonly accepted goals of software
	      development, then critique the tools by which we come to arrive at those goals.
	      We will be exploring tools and associated nomenclature that we may have never
	      seen or used before, so that you may later investigate further and develop an
	      understanding and opinion.</p>

	    <p class="description">Subjects covered in detail include functional programming, abstraction and
	      parametricity.</p>

	    <p class="description">We will also take a glance at some of the doo-doo that is written on the
	      internet about these subjects, so as to keep in check our means of critical
	      inquiry.

            <p class="description">One of the big changes in Django 1.3 was
              the introduction of Class-Based Views. Opinion on them is
              strongly divided; some love them, some hate them.<br /><br />
              In this talk, we'll look at the history that led to the
              development of Class-Based Views, and the current state of play.
              We'll look at some interesting design patterns that are possible
              by exploiting the features of Class-Based views. And we'll look
              to what the future could hold for Django's Class-based
              future.</p>

              the best ways of managing transactions in your Django app,
              including pre-1.6 and 1.6 and later feature sets. Included in
              the discussion will be database-specific features (mostly
              PostgreSQL), and an overview of some advanced topics such as
              transaction isolation modes and two-phase commit.</p>

            <p class="description">Digital Humanities is the application of
              computer technology or computer-based quantitive methods to the
              problems and data of the disciplines of the Humanities. This
              paper will details some of the lessons learned by a recovering
              Java and C programmer in implementing a new Digital Humanities
              project on the Django platform. Using experience gleaned from
              two decades of programming experience and an ongoing PhD
              candidature in Classics and Ancient History, it will detail some
              of the gaps that need to be bridged between the two worlds and
              how Python APIs like Django and lxml can be used to bridge them,
              as well as what remains currently unsolved. It will also explore
              how the Tasty Pie REST framework for Django can be leveraged to
              solve particular types of problems in the Digital Humanities in
              creating textual annotations and linked data sets.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="description">As Django developers we use a multitude of reusable apps that solve common problems that we all face, to help us ship features faster. Sometimes, you face a problem that leaves you thinking "surely someone has written an app for this", but you can't find anything. This is when you want to start writing your own reusable app.</p>

	    <p class="description">This talk will have a look at some of the best existing reusable apps and see what lessons can be learnt from them, then walk through every facet of developing a reusable and discuss the best practises that have emerged.</p>

	    <p class="description">You can expect to walk away from this talk with all the knowledge you need to go and write your first reusable app.</p>
